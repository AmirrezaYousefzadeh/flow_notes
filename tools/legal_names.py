"""Give every escaped identifier of a routed netlist a plain name, consistently in the netlist, its SDF and its SPEF.

Usage: legal_names.py <netlist.nl.v> <delays.sdf> <parasitics.spef> <out dir>
Writes <out dir>/design.nl.v, design.sdf, design.spef and names.tsv (plain name <tab> original name).

Why: the routed netlist of a design with sub-modules or generate loops names its cells and nets by their hierarchical
path, as Verilog escaped identifiers such as `\\u_rom.u_col_0/_307_ ` or `\\g_ws[9].u_icg `. Icarus Verilog cannot
annotate SDF delays onto such instances (it splits the name at the dot), and OpenSTA reads the slash in a SPEF name as a
hierarchy divider, so the parasitics of these nets are lost. The gate-level simulation and the power analysis therefore
both run on renamed copies: every escaped identifier becomes a plain one (each character other than a letter, a digit
or '_' replaced by '_', plus a suffix when that name exists already). The netlist spells such a name `\\a.b/c `, SDF and
SPEF spell it `a\\.b\\/c`, and SPEF also `a\\.b/c` (so a net of a sub-module, `\\u_demux/_000_ ` in the netlist, is
plain `u_demux/_000_` in the SPEF); ports and bus bits keep their names.
